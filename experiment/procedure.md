### Procedure
## Step 1:
Understand the Problem statement provided, understand the relations between different variables.
## Step 2:
Add necessary components (nodes which are part of the domain the problem statement is discussing).
Addition of any irrelevant nodes will lead to a wrong Bayesian Network.
## Step 3: 
You will be provided hints about relation between random variables based on which you need to add edges between the components. You need to use these hints because there can be many correct answers but for the practical purposes of this experiment you are restricted to provide us an answer based on provided hints.
## Step 4:
Once you construct the graph click on submit, depending on whether your construction is correct or not you will be shown a message.
## Step 5: 
After getting sucess messages hover over the nodes to get CPT tables of them.
## Step 6:
Some of them are incomplete, tap on them and complete the table.
